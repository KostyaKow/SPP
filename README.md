SPP
===

Scheme interpreter written in C++.

I am trying to write a Scheme interpreter in several different languages I am studying. This is mainly for practice and learning, and is not intended to be serious project.

Compilation instruction:

Linux:

cd SPP; make

or use the Code::Blocks project.

OS X:

I haven't tested this on Mac, but should be same as Linux.

Windows:

You will have to download & install the newest version of MinGW. MinGW that comes with Code::Blocks is too old, and can't handle some of the C++11 features I use.
I have not tested this with Visual Studio.

SPP
===

Lisp interpreter written in C++.

Compilation instruction:

GNU/Linux & other Unix systems using GCC:

cd SPP; make

Windows:

You will have to download & install the newest version of MinGW. MinGW that comes with Code::Blocks is too old, and can't handle some of the C++11 features I use.
I have not tested this with Visual Studio.

		*Code Notes*

I mostly use CamelCase for variable, class and function names.

functions	- Starts with lowercase, and subsequent letters are uppercase (someFunction).
variable names  - Same as functions.
classes		- Starts with UpperCase, and all subsequent letters are also uppercase (SomeClass). 

		*Hungarian prefixes*

m_	- signifies that the variables passed to a function will be changed inside a function.
h_	- used to signify local helper functions (made with auto and lambdas).
r_	- values returned from the function have this prefix.
n_	- number of something

   *Notes about language*

This project implements a small small Lisp. 


I use Clojure style syntax to evaluate only part of the list, i.e.

=> (42 42)

Error

=> '(42 42)

(42 42)

=> (let ((x 3)) '(x 42))

(x 42)

=> let ((x 123)) '(~x 42))

(~x 42)

=> (let ((x 16)) `(x 42))

(x 42)

=> (let ((x 16) (y 3)) `(~x ~y 42))

(16 3 42)

For further examples look in the tests directory.

Also, for now, there is no negative numbers ;)

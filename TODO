* Re-write and cleanup code to make it readable by other people
   * Change the formatting parsing & functions

* Use Lex and Yacc


-----------------------------

I am currently taking Stanford's Compilers class at Coursera, and I am trying to apply my knowledge to this project. This is a place to take notes, and record things that I want to add or change.

* Rename
   - "words" ( 1 2 '( ~( ) "fdsf fsd fd") should be re-named "tokens" (lexical analysis).
   

- Parsing is grouping of words. 
- Semantic Analysis analyzes meaning.
